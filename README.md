# To-do List App that gives 3 action steps

Video demo: https://youtu.be/J0w8G-PhsXI  

Users can add, delete, and check off items on to do list. Clicking on the generate next steps buttons, will generate three next steps for those tasks. Deleting a task off of the original to do list will also delete the next steps off of the next steps table, but deleting a next step will not delete a task from the original to do list. Used OpenAI API to generate next steps and MySQL for the database that stores the information on the to do list. Items on the to do list will not be lost or deleted unless manually deleted.
